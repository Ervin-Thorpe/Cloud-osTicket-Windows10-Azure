<h2>Description</h2>
This repository offers a step-by-step guide for deploying and configuring an osTicket system on a Windows 10 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure. It includes comprehensive instructions on setting up prerequisites, installing necessary software, and configuring the osTicket application. 
<br />
<br />
The guide covers everything from virtual machine creation in Microsoft Azure and prerequisite installations to post-installation setup, including administration, user management, and ticket resolution. Ideal for home network support, it provides a robust ticketing solution with detailed steps for ensuring a fully functional and efficient support system.
<br />
<br />
Due to the depth of the project, it's been broken down into 3 parts:
<br />
<br />

  - Prerequisites and Installations
  - Post-Installation and Configurations
  - Use Cases of the built Ticketing System
<br />
This will be found below
