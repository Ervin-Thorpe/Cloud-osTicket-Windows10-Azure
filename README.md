<h1>Cloud-Based Ticketing System for Technical Support on Windows 10 Using Microsoft Azure</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
I implemented a fully functional osTicket system on a Windows 10 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, designed for home network support. This project showcases my skills in cloud infrastructure, system administration, and IT service management.
<br />
<br />
Key accomplishments: <br /> <br />

- Deployed and configured a Windows 10 VM on Microsoft Azure
- Set up IIS web server, PHP, MySQL, and related components
- Installed and customized osTicket for specific support needs
- Configured user roles, departments, and teams within osTicket
- Implemented Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and help topics
- Deployed the system to a live environment with a custom domain name and SSL certificate for secure access
- Currently managing and resolving real user tickets for technical support

This ticketing system demonstrates my ability to create, manage, and maintain a cloud-based IT support solution, from initial setup to full deployment and live operations. The system is actively used to handle and resolve technical support tickets from real users, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in IT support and ticketing system management.
